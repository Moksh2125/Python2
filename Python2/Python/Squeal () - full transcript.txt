It's better
to die in freedom from starvation


than to be satiated in slavery.


Farmer's daughter Kirke


took a more pessimistic
view on the liberation.


Dwelling upon the likelihood


that the piglet had
already been torn to pieces


and devoured by
the local wolves.


The animal had no idea that
his first day of freedom


would soon end up


in the most ridiculous
and incredible accident…


To be caused by the
main hero of our tale,


Samuel or Chef Sam as
he liked to be called.


The young man had arrived in a
country that he had never heard of


to find his father he
had never seen before.


Hey!


Hey, hey, hey!


- Do you speak English?
- No.


Do you know this man?


His name is Lazins.


Ladins... Hey!


Hey!


What the fuck!


Destination not found.


No, no, no, no! Come on!


Fuck!


Fuck.


You owe me, you
know that, right?


Do you know Lazdins?


What the fuck am I saying?
Just a fucking pig.


Hello?


I don't understand.


English?


Do you speak English?


Pig is a money.


Fine.


I'll take you home.


I mean... I even
don't know where I am.


- He's suffering too much.
- No. He's just too happy.


The
only one disappointed


by the recent turn of
events, was the piglet.


He would have preferred
to be devoured by wolves


rather than return to
his boring, filthy life


surrounded by wretched congeners
and miserable human beings.


Dammit!


Loose again.


Wait, wait. Let me do it.


Here you go.


And you?


I don't drink.


Okay.


Where are you from?


I come from...


a noisy place.


Not like this.


There's almost...


no people left out here.


Just pigs.


And we're selling
them little by little.


Maybe we'll have to
move to the city.


I guess you can't
wait to do that.


No.


No, I want to stay here.


Just like my mother wanted.


Do you know a man named...


Ladzins?


Lazins?


La... La... Ladzins


Do you know him? You know him.


No.


You're probably tired.


I...


Don't be scared.


My mum won't disturb your sleep.


She was an English teacher.


This is the best place.


Stay as long as you like.


We have... plenty of room and...


food.


That's very kind, but I've...


…got to get going
in the morning.


Hot food, a warm bed
and the caring hands of a woman


are enough to soothe the brow
of the most frantic traveler.


Soon he would forget not only
about searching for his father


but also about his faithful
companion, loneliness.


Or as he called it, freedom.


Peace of mind was such a rare state
in the life of this young man.


Kirke tried very hard
to dismiss the thought


that soon she would
never see him again.


She was enormously impressed


by the nobleness of
the foreigner's manner.


And the feeling of empathy
she believed he had for her.


Indeed the young lady was
grateful to her mother


for such a generous gift.


Hi!


What's going on?


Maybe if you
ask him about Lazins?


Yeah!


Yeah. You know where
I can find him?


Can you translate?
I don't understand.


Jancuks
had grown up in these parts.


He had never known anything
but the sun, the trees


and the ambition to marry Kirke.


Neither the old man
nor his daughter


suspected the aspirations
of their frequent guest.


In some dark corner of
his tiny jealous mind,


he imagined Sam touching Kirke.


The graphic image he summoned up


irritated and aroused
him in equal measure.


Let me go!


Look at me!


Look at me!


Now watch.


Mix.


And feed.


Like this.


Please.


Do it.


You will get some normal food.


If you do what I say.


If not...


my father will punish you.


Believe me, I don't
want it to happen.


This is for you.


I'm not your pig.


If you
want to be happy...


you have to obey.


No, no, no, no! Hey! Hey! Shh!


Shh! Hey! Shh!


Hey, hey!


Shee!


Shh! Shh!


Help me!


Help me! Please. Help me!


Help me!


Brothers
Vilhelms and Marks


were blessed by good health,


pragmatic minds and
senseless hearts.


These qualities were perfect


for managing and maintaining
a prosperous farm.


The brothers lived in harmony
with their chickens, cows,


turkeys and their faithful,
but clumsy Jancuks.


Please!


Please!


Hey, hey, help me! Help!


Hey, help me! Help!


At this moment,
they had a great chance


of replacing him with
a better labourer.


Please!


Even the pigs will
be scared of you.


What did he say?


He thanked you for
saving my life.


I only saved your nose.


Dad loves you.


Why did you lure me here?


You offered me the ride.


I never asked for that.


You tricked me.


You drank my vodka.


I never forced you to.


Now it's time to work.


The hard physical work
was a way to disperse thoughts


about the inhuman
conditions of his existence


to which Sam had
become accustomed.


The shower reassured the pigs


that someone was
taking care of them.


Cleanliness is to some a virtue,


to some a necessity,
to others - a luxury.


No.


No. No,
no, no. No. No.


Mamma.


Fuck!


My mamma.


Stop moving.
The party starts soon.


You're not sitting with
everyone until you're clean.


Dad wants to show you.
Make the brothers jealous.


What do I say to people?


I don't speak the language.


Put a smile on your face.


Look pretty, I guess.


Turn your back.


Bend over.


You have to wash
from time to time.


Sets a good example
to the other pigs.


I'm not a pig.


I’m not finished.


You should go.


I was not
gonna run, you idiots!


I have a chain around my neck.


Despite
Kirke's certainty


regarding the righteousness
of the punishment


she still took pleasure in
having a man beside her.


One who listened, obeyed
and even smiled sometimes.


Instead of finding his father,
Sam had met the first woman


who had succeeded in
making him suffer.


For now, the torment
was merely physical.


Mental torture was no more
than a promise for the future.


What?


There's no way out
of this. Leave!


Go, Jancuks, go!


The lonely
heart of an abandoned woman


is sad and cruel.


Kirke would prefer to die


rather than return to
her boring, lonely life


with the stubborn, sickly
half-witted father.


The young
lady was horrified by the thought


that Sam could have been
torn to pieces by wolves.


If only she knew the
foreigner would soon return.


Driven by strong feelings
and exalted intentions.


Fuck!


Fuck!


Fuck!


Where did you get this?


Thank you.


You hear that?


I dreamt of going home.


No.


My real home.


Far away from here.


For the
first time in his life


Sam had so many pairs of ears
listening to his every word.


Even though they
understood none of it.


Sam's heart burst with a
desire to care and lead.


But there was no one
he could love here.


You're a pig. I'm a human.


Before we ate the same food
because there was no choice.


Out here, things are different.


Sam's search
for Lagzdins had failed.


He didn't have the strength
to go back home anymore.


No one was waiting
or missing him.


Kirke couldn't stop
thinking about him.


Remembering happier times
when Sam was chained up


staring at her with
his trusting eyes.


The only thing she could
do was wait and hope.


Love...


What changes it wreaks
in the heart of a man!


What strange actions,


inexplicable to the
unaffected mind,


has it caused on
so many occasions!


However... unlike a woman,


a man is never able to
admit this to himself.


It's just...


I never experienced
such feelings.


You want to laugh and
cry at the same time.


Kirke.


Despite the persuasive
nature of his companions,


Sam had a determination
to go back to Kirke.


If only the pigs could've
known that soon they would meet


the singularly horrifying
fate of being burned alive.


You don't have to follow me.


For me it is.


It's wolves howling.


Run!


Easy.


Sam
was grateful to fate


for honouring him with the
chance to return to Kirke


neither a slave nor labourer,


but as a conquering hero
in the aftermath of battle.


The foreigner was indeed
God's gift to all.


My father has
lost a bullet and...


asks you to help find it.


What you're looking for might
be right in front of you.


You understood what
my father said?


He said...


He wants us to marry.


Let's do it.


You're burning, Kirke.


Yes, I do, Sam.


Hey!


Despite being
innocent of the arson at the pig farm,


Vilhelms and Marks paid
compensation for the losses


and agreed to bury the hatchet.


Soon they would lose
all their livestock


to an outbreak of bird
flu and face bankruptcy.


They would later be found
hanging in the chicken coop.


Gustavs
never saw his bloodline continue.


His old heart stopped beating
on their wedding night.


The pig's
farewell filled Sam's heart


with an all-encompassing
sadness.


At this moment, he realized


his journey had been devoid
of any sense or meaning.


Having given up his freedom
and not having found Lagzdins.


Suddenly, Sam
was racked with doubt.


He wondered if he
should abandon Kirke


and to continue his journey.


Even though in freedom


he would encounter
even greater threats.
